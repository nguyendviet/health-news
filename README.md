# Health News

https://github.com/nguyendviet/health-news/blob/master/yarn.lock


## Overview
A full stack (MERN) app that allows users to get top medical articles from Medical News Today and provide options to read or to save to database for later reading.

### Demo
* Heroku: [Health News](https://health-news.herokuapp.com/)

### Logic
* Users click Get Articles button to getarticles from Medical News Today. Users then can choose to view articles on their website or to save articles' links to my database.
* Users can go to the Saved Articles page to read saved articles or to remove them.
* The app won't get articles that have been already saved in my database to prevent duplicates.

## Installation
Make sure you've already installed yarn. For more information, please read the [Yarn Documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

After cloning the repo to your local machine, go to its folder and run:
```

Next, go to folder **client/**:
```

Then go back to the root folder:
```

Start express and react at the same time:
